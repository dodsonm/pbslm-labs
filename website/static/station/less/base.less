/**
 * Welcome! This is the file you want to compile to make the site work!
 *  1.  First things first, we include bootstrap.less. Thing is, it's
 *      full of stuff we don't need -- yet. The plan is to activate the 
 *      components as we need them, to reduce the size and complexity
 *      of the CSS. We could edit bootstrap.less directly (it's in the
 *      vendors/bootstrap/ folder) but tyhat makes upfrades difficult.
 *      Instead, there's a duplicate in this folder called 
 *      custom-bootstrap.less. Edit it to actovate components. If
 *      bootstrap.less changes when upgrading bootstrap, edit this file
 *      to refelect those changes.
 *  2.  This reset is better than the Bootstrap version and 
 *      overrides it.
 *  3.  vars.less holds some global variables
 *  4.  Put your mixins here
 *  5.  An alternative Nav object, since Boostrap over-extends the 
 *      standard nav object. This is the standard nav object, but it uses
 *      an alternative 
 *  6.  The Matrix object creates a grid form a list
 *  7.  Imports our custom fonts and sets up the font stack
 *  8.  Global colour variables
 *  9.  global typography styles
 * 10.  styles specifically dealing with responsive display changes
 * 11.  sometimes bootstrap grids do silly things. overrides go here.
 * 12.  Finally, LMsite specific styles. Here are global styles used 
 *      everywhere in the site.
 * 13.  site-header is the header and navigation used throughout the 
 *      entire site
 * 14.  search-bar is a page object used throughout the entire site
 * 15.  footer is a page object used throughout the entire site
